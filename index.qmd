My name is **Karen Cruz** and I am currently 22 years old. 
I am currently on my second semester doing the Master's in Statistics program at CUNY Baruch.

There's a multitude of things I enjoy doing during my free time such as trying new foods and restaurants, playing sports, traveling, and the list goes on. Fortunately, I reside in NYC, where you can try gastronomy from all over the world at every corner of the city. As for traveling, one of my favorite places I have traveled to was Kyoto, Japan. It was such a surreal experience I think about everyday. This is my [LinkenIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-cruz-), if anyone wants to follow me!
